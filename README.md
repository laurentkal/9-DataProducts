# Project for the Developing data products Coursera course

This repo contain the files of my shiny project for Coursera course. 
The shiny app provides interactive visualizations on alcohol consumption throughout the world, based on the World Health Organization data. The dataset was loaded from the FiveThirtyEight github page.
